=Advanced configuration for the SharePoint connector=
== Configure the connectorInstance.xml file ==
 
The advanced configuration is done through the modification of the file connectorInstance.xml. After modification put connectorInstance.xml in the folder /connector-manager/WEB-INF/connectors/sharepoint-connector/instance_of_connector/ 

 
==== Change !BlackList and !WhiteList ====
 
By modifying the value of the property named “blackList”, you can provide the list of metadata which should not be fed to the appliance (blacklisted-metadata).

For e.g. 
<property name="blackList">
	<list>
		<value>vti_cachedcustomprops</value>
	</list>
</property>


By modifying the value of the property named “whiteList”, you can provide the list of metadata which appliance can crawl for a document.

For e.g.     
  <property name="whiteList">
	<list>
		<value>vti_title</value>
	</list>
</property>


The connector does not crawl the list of metadata specified in blacklist and whitelist. 
If you wish to add a metadata in the included list or excluded list for the connector, you have to add a line between the tags and : `name_of_the_metadata` 
Once the modification of the file is done, you have to restart the connector service. 

   
 
==== Enable/Disable FQDN Resolution for Host Names====
 
'FQDNConversion' property, if set to true would convert the document and attachment URLs as fetched by the connector to FQDN format. 
For e.g. [[http://moss_host1/]]  will be converted to [[http://moss_host1.yourdomain.com/]]. 
The default value is set to false.

Note: The FQDN resolution will happen using the Connector system's name resolution. Hosts not accesible from the connector machine will not be resolved.
