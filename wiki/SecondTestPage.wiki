Any line that starts with 4 or more dashes should produce a horizontal rule even if text follows:

----

Between two HRs
---- Text after pushed to next line

Text formatting

This: __underlined__ Produces: underlined

This: ''emphasized'' Produces: emphasized

This: '''strong''' Produces: strong

This: a^2^ + b^2^ = c^2^ Produces: a2 + b2 = c2

This: H,,2,,O Produces: H2O

Mixing like this: '''''Mix''' at the beginning'' Produces: Mix at the beginning

Mixing like this: '''''Mix'' in __the middle__ and the beginning''' Produces: Mix in the middle and the beginning

Interleaved mixing like this: '''Interleaved __mixing''' even works__ Produces: Interleaved mixing even works

Mixing inside superscript and subscript like this: F^__super__^ A,,'''sub''',, Doesn't work: F__super__ A'''sub'''

But mixing superscript and subscript inside others: __F^super^__ '''A,,sub,,''' Does: Fsuper Asub
Lists and Definitions

This:

  * one bullet
    * nested to level 2
      * nested to level 3
        * nested to level 4
  * second bullet
    1. nested numbered list (doesn't work)
    2. nested numbered list (doesn't work)
  * third bullet

Produces:

    *

      one bullet
          o

            nested to level 2
                +

                  nested to level 3
                      #

                        nested to level 4
    *

      second bullet
         1.

            nested numbered list
         2.

            nested numbered list
    *

      third bullet

This:

  1. Top-level numbered list
  2. Top-level numbered list
    * nested bullet
    * nested bullet
  3. See if we keep the numbering here!

Produces:

   1.

      Top-level numbered list
   2.

      Top-level numbered list
          *

            nested bullet
          *

            nested bullet
   3.

      See if we keep the numbering here!

This:

  Term:: a definition
  Another Term:: another definition, but with ''markup''
  :: a definition without a term

Produces:

Term

    a definition
Another Term

    another definition, but with markup

    a definition without a term

But this:

* First bullet without leading space(s)
1. Numbered list without leading space(s)
Term/Definition markup:: without leading space(s)

Doesn't work without leading spaces: * First bullet without leading space(s) 1. Numbered list without leading space(s) Term/Definition markup:: without leading space(s)
Inline code

Doing this: {{{Inline with braces}}} or this `Inline with backticks` Produces this: Inline with braces and Inline with backticks.

Putting the braces on different lines runs the code bock the full width, so this:

The following should show up as a full block of inline code <three left braces>
c = sqrt(a*a + b*b)
<three right braces>

Produces:

The following should show up as a full block of inline code

c = sqrt(a*a + b*b)

Note that I have to use <three left braces> in the code block above because I'm using the inline code block feature to create the example.
Linking and graphics

In a Wiki page, you use [square brackets]? to create links. When you save the page, the contents of the square bracketed text will have a small ? link next to it, which you click to create a new page with that name. This is the primary way to create new pages in a wiki.
