Horizontal rules don't work:

Any line that starts with 4 or more dashes should produce a horizontal rule even if text follows:

----
-----
------
-------
--------
Between two HRs
---- Text after pushed to next line

=Text formatting=

This: __bold__ works

This: _italic_ works

This: ~~strikethrough~~ works

This: __underlined__ doesn't work

This: ''emphasized'' doesn't work

This: '''strong''' doesn't work

This: a^2^ + b^2^ = c^2^ works nicely

This: H,,2,,O works nicely

Mixing like this: '''''Mix''' at the beginning'' Produces: Mix at the beginning

=Lists and Definitions=

This seems to work well:

  * one bullet
    * nested to level 2
      * nested to level 3
        * nested to level 4
  * second bullet
    # nested numbered list (doesn't work)
    # nested numbered list (doesn't work)
  * third bullet

This:

  # Top-level numbered list
  # Top-level numbered list
    * nested bullet
    * nested bullet
  # See if we keep the numbering here!

This:

  Term:: a definition
  Another Term:: another definition, but with ''markup''
  :: a definition without a term

Produces:

Term

    a definition
Another Term

    another definition, but with markup

    a definition without a term

But this:

* First bullet without leading space(s)
1. Numbered list without leading space(s)
Term/Definition markup:: without leading space(s)

Doesn't work without leading spaces: * First bullet without leading space(s) 1. Numbered list without leading space(s) Term/Definition markup:: without leading space(s)
Inline code

Doing this: {{{Inline with braces}}} or this `Inline with backticks` Produces this: Inline with braces and Inline with backticks.

Putting the braces on different lines runs the code bock the full width, so this:

The following should show up as a full block of inline code <three left braces>
c = sqrt(a*a + b*b)
<three right braces>

Produces:

The following should show up as a full block of inline code

c = sqrt(a*a + b*b)

Note that I have to use <three left braces> in the code block above because I'm using the inline code block feature to create the example.
Linking and graphics

In a Wiki page, you use [square brackets]? to create links. When you save the page, the contents of the square bracketed text will have a small ? link next to it, which you click to create a new page with that name. This is the primary way to create new pages in a wiki.
