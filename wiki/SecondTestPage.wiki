=Text formatting=

This: __bold__ works

This: _italic_ works

This: ~~strikethrough~~ works

This: a^2^ + b^2^ = c^2^ works nicely

This: H,,2,,O works nicely

=Lists and Definitions=

This seems to work well:

  * one bullet
    * nested to level 2
      * nested to level 3
        * nested to level 4
  * second bullet
    # nested numbered list (doesn't work)
    # nested numbered list (doesn't work)
  * third bullet

So does this:

  # Top-level numbered list
  # Top-level numbered list
    * nested bullet
    * nested bullet
  # See if we keep the numbering here!

Definition lists don't work.

=Inline code=

How about this: {{{Inline with braces}}} and this `Inline with backticks` 

Putting the braces on different lines runs the code bock the full width, so this:

The following should show up as a full block of inline code{{{
c = sqrt(a*a + b*b)
}}}
