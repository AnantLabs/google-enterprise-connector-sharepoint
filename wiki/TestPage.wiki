Here is some *bold* *text*.  *Look, this whole sentence is bold!*  I wonder if I can get an actual star in the text?  How about back-slash star: \*

Some more things to try:
  # A numbered list.
  # Suppose I have a list item that just goes on and on.  I mean really long - longer than 80 characters, longer than anyone might expect.  I think it gets broken at a fairly reasonable place.  I mean, it looks pretty good and when I resize the window it still looks decent
  # I wonder about line spacing

Here is a paragraph.  It starts two new-lines after the previous list.
Here is something that is apparently not a paragraph.  It starts just one new-line after the previous paragraph.

This paragraph starts two new-lines after the previous one.  It actually is a pragraph.

Look at this neat table!

|| Column1 || Column2||
|| blue    || green  ||

Wow!  

What happens with a mal-formed table?

|| col1 || col2||
|| cell1 || cell2 || cell3 ||
|| just one cell ||
