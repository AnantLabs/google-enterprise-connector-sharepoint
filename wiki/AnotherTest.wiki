=Text formatting=

This: *bold* works

This: _italic_ works

This: ~~strikethrough~~ works

This: a^2^ + b^2^ = c^2^ works nicely

This: H,,2,,O works nicely

=Lists and Definitions=

This seems to work well:

  * one bullet
    * nested to level 2
      * nested to level 3
        * nested to level 4
  * second bullet
    # nested numbered list (doesn't work)
    # nested numbered list (doesn't work)
  * third bullet

So does this:

  # Top-level numbered list
  # Top-level numbered list
    * nested bullet
    * nested bullet
  # See if we keep the numbering here!

Definition lists don't work.

=Inline code=

How about this: {{{Inline with braces}}} and this `Inline with backticks`

Putting the braces on different lines runs the code bock the full
width, so this:

=Links=

In a Wiki page, you use [NonexistentPage] to create links. When you
save the page, the contents of the square bracketed text will have a
small ? link next to it, which you click to create a new page with
that name. This is the primary way to create new pages in a wiki.

Here are some links:

 * http://www.cylab.cmu.edu/
 * [http://www.cylab.cmu.edu/]
 * [ http://www.cylab.cmu.edu/ Carnegie Mellon CyLab]
 * ftp://www.nowwhere.com/pub/docs
 * mailto:no-one@nowhere.com
 * [TestPage] Link inside of this wiki
